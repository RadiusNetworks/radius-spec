# For our Rails apps several of them use the `respond_to` with `format` blocks
# to handle various mime types (mostly HTML and JSON). Given our `do` / `end`
# block style for non-functional blocks (which includes both `respond_to` and
# `format`) the general method limit of is too small. This also applies to the
# helper methods which define the allowed parameters for the action; especially
# for larger forms.
#
# Here is an example of a minimal controller `update` method which uses the
# `respond_to` style to support just the HTML and JSON formats:
#
#   ```ruby
#   def update
#     respond_to do |format|
#       if @resource.update(resource_params)
#         format.html do
#           redirect_to resources_url, notice: 'Resource was successfully updated.'

# The ActiveSupport monkey patches for `present?` are nearly all defined as:
