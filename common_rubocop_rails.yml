# Ignore subclass parent for one off benchmarks
#
# Benchmarks are generally meant to be small and targeted. They often have
# custom model declarations which help direct the focus of the benchmarks.
# These one-off models exist outside of the main Rails app. We don't want this
# cop to run for them because including `ApplicationRecord` is unnecessary in
# these cases and just adds noise to the setup.

# The ActiveSupport monkey patches for `present?` are nearly all defiend as:
#
#     !blank?
#
# For most of use `unless blank?` reads just as easily as `if present?`.
# Sometimes contextually, it can read better depending on the branch logic and
# surrounding context. As `if present?` requires an additional negation and
# method call it is technically slower. In the general case the perf different
# isn't much but in some cases it matters. Thus, we are not enforcing changing
# `unless blank?` to `if present?` and are leaving it up to the context to
# decide which is a better fit.

# We prefer you use the attribute readers and writes. For those special cases

# According to the Rails docs while the following methods skip validations they

#
# We are not excluding `toggle!` because it's more likely that a flag may have
