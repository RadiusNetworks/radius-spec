# We generally prefer to use the default line length of 80. Though sometimes

# The double negation idiom is a common Ruby-ism. All languages have various
# idioms and part of learning the language is learning the common idioms. Once
# learning the meaning it is not cryptic as Rubocop implies.
#
#   > Double negation converts converts a value to boolean.
#   >
#   > It converts "truthy" values to `true` and "falsey" values, `nil` and
#   > `false`, to `false`.
#
# The [Rubocop style guide](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide#no-bang-bang)
# does have a valid complaint about it's use in a conditional:
#
#   > you don't need this explicit conversion in the condition of a control
#   > expression; using it only obscures your intention...
#   >
#   > ```ruby
#   > # bad
#   > x = 'test'
#   > # obscure nil check
#   > if !!x
#   >   # body omitted

#
# This is true and we completely agree. However the check isn't limited to just
# conditional control expressions. It affects any use of the idiom.
#
# We believe using the idiom is completely valid for predicate methods to
# ensure either a `true` or `false` return, instead of just a "truthy" or
# "falsey" response. As it is an op it is a bit faster than the alternative of
# sending `nil?` to the object and more concise than using `obj == nil`. It
# also works with something that is potentially `false` as expected.

# As we cannot customize this to only limit it to the conditional control
# expressions, or instances which may be better replaced with something else

# If you only need to rescue a single, or predefined set of exceptions, then
# catch the exceptions explicitly. However, when you need to include a general
# error handler / "catch-all" use the "unspecified rescue".
#
# Using the unspecified `rescue` on blocks is common Ruby practice. It is a
# core feature of the language which has semantic meaning. The Rubocop docs do
# not provide much justification for defaulting to an explicit style and there
# is no real mention of this in the associated style guide except the following
# buried in an example for [_Avoid rescuing the `Exception`
# class_](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#no-blind-rescues) though
# the anchor suggests this is for "no blind rescues":
#
# > # a blind rescue rescues from StandardError, not Exception as many
# > # programmers assume.
#
# Our general rule for Ruby exceptions is to create your custom errors from
# `StandardError`. Creating custom errors off of `Exception` is reserved for
# special edge cases where you don't intend for someone to normally catch it
# (such as system resource issues; e.g. `NoMemoryError`, `SecurityError`).
#
# With that in mind, we can make the same counter argument that since
# programmers generally assume the unspecified rescue rescues `Exception`,
# which they normally should not be rescuing, system errors are more likely to
# noticed.
#
# Additionally, use of the unspecified rescue looks and behaves like a
# "catch-all" or the `else` clause in a `case` statement:
#
#   begin
#     # do something that may cause a standard error
#   rescue TypeError
#     handle_type_error
