# If you only need to rescue a single, or predefined set of exceptions, then
# catch the exceptions explicitly. However, when you need to include a general
# error handler / "catch-all" use the "unspecified rescue".
#
# Using the unspecified `rescue` on blocks is common Ruby practice. It is a
# core feature of the language which has semantic meaning. The Rubocop docs do
# not provide much justification for defaulting to an explicit style and there
# is no real mention of this in the associated style guide except the following
# buried in an example for [_Avoid rescuing the `Exception`
# class_](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#no-blind-rescues) though
# the anchor suggests this is for "no blind rescues":
#
# > # a blind rescue rescues from StandardError, not Exception as many
# > # programmers assume.
#
# Our general rule for Ruby exceptions is to create your custom errors from
# `StandardError`. Creating custom errors off of `Exception` is reserved for
# special edge cases where you don't intend for someone to normally catch it
# (such as system resource issues; e.g. `NoMemoryError`, `SecurityError`).
#
# With that in mind, we can make the same counter argument that since
# programmers generally assume the unspecified rescue rescues `Exception`,
# which they normally should not be rescuing, system errors are more likely to
# noticed.
#
# Additionally, use of the unspecified rescue looks and behaves like a
# "catch-all" or the `else` clause in a `case` statement:
#
#   begin
#     # do something that may cause a standard error
#   rescue TypeError
#     handle_type_error
#   rescue => e
#     handle_error e

# We don't feel too strongly about percent vs bracket array style. We tend to

# Configuration parameters: EnforcedStyle, MinSize, WordRegex.
# SupportedStyles: percent, brackets
