Basic RSpec setup and plug-ins for use with Radius Networks Ruby / Rails
projects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'radius-spec'
```

And then execute:

```console
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```console
$ gem install radius-spec
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
